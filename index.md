# TC39 Code of Conduct

## References

### Ecma Bylaws Article 5.1 (extract):

> Membership of a company shall be terminated in the following cases:
> ...
> - by expulsion for violation of Bylaws and Rules or for any other conduct prejudicial to the interest and correct functioning of the Association.

### Ecma Bylaws, Articles 5.3, 5.4 5.5:

> 5.3 Any proposal to expel an Ecma member shall be backed by at least one-fifth of all the ordinary members. The proposal to expel shall be on the agenda for the General Assembly at which is it going to be discussed so as to give the member the opportunity to present its case.
> 5.4 A two-thirds majority of all the ordinary members is necessary to expel an Ecma member. Such expulsion will become effective 15 days after notification by registered mail.
> 5.5 An Ecma member which had been expelled can only be re-admitted by the General Assembly with a two-thirds majority of all ordinary members.

TC39 has specified further the terms of “prejudicial conduct” and has expanded on how to deal with incidents that can lead to it, in the (currently experimental) TC39Code of Conduct below. Other committees may want to have similar codes.

### Introduction

Like the technical community as a whole, TC39 is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the world. To ensure a fair and balanced standards process, to avoid communication issues and unhappiness, and to promote inclusiveness, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate and empower others to speak.

This Code of Conduct is enforced within all spaces managed by TC39. This includes IRC channels moderated by TC39, mailing lists such as esdiscuss, issue trackers on projects hosted by TC39, and TC39 events and meetings.

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing [tc39-conduct-reports@googlegroups.com][tc39-conduct]. For more details, please see our [Reporting Guidelines][].

### Be respectful

Respect is a fundamental value of the standardization work. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the TC39 community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the TC39 community.

### Be friendly and patient

We understand that everyone has different levels of experience or knowledge in many diverse fields, be it technical or nontechnical in nature. We also have areas of knowledge we are eager to expand. We want to be a community where people can not only contribute, but feel comfortable to ask questions as well and learn along the way. When correcting another participant, respond with patience and try to keep it polite and civil. Remember that we all were newbies at one point.

### Be inclusive

We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

### Be considerate

Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you make will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.

### Be careful in the words that you choose

We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Violent threats or language directed against another person.
* Discriminatory jokes and language.
* Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
* Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
* Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
* Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

### When we disagree, try to understand why

Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. There is strength in having a varied community with people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
