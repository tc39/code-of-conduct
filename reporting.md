# Reporting Guidelines

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing [tc39-conduct-reports@googlegroups.com][tc39-conduct]. All reports will be kept confidential. Only members of the [Code of Conduct Committee](/code-of-conduct-proposal/subcommittee), and possibly the Ecma ExeCom, will receive the reports. No identity will be made public before the individuals concerned have agreed to it.

If the act is ongoing, the Chair, Vice-Chair or any member of the Code of Conduct Committee should take immediate measures to stop it if possible, and to gather the information described below.

In your report please include:

*   Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up).
*   Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
*   When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
*   Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger) please include a link. Screenshots can be useful in the case something is edited or deleted before action is taken.
*   Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
*   If you believe this incident is ongoing.
*   Any other information you believe we should have.

### What happens after you file a report?

Reports will receive urgent and immediate attention from the Code of Conduct Committee. Please refer to the [Enforcement Manual][] for the complete information on how reports will be processed.

### Appealing

To appeal a decision of the Code of Conduct Committee, contact the [Ecma Secretariat][] which will transfer the matter to the Ecma ExeCom.
