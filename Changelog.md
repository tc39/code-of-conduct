# Change Control Process

We're (mostly) programmers, so we'll track changes to the Code of Conduct and associated documents the same way we track changes to code. All changes will be proposed via a pull request to this repository. Changes will be reviewed by the [conduct committee][] first—approved changes will be merged, published, and noted below.

This only applies to material changes; changes that don't affect the intent (typo fixes, re-wordings, etc.) can be made immediately.
