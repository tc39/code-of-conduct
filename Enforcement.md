# Enforcement Manual

This is the enforcement manual followed by TC39's Code of Conduct Enforcement Subcommittee. It's used when we respond to an issue to make sure we're consistent and fair.

### The Code of Conduct Enforcement Subcommittee

All responses to reports of conduct violations will be managed by a [Code of Conduct Enforcement Subcommittee][] ("the subcommittee").

TC39 will establish this subcommittee, comprised of at least three members. One member will be designated chair of the subcommittee and will be responsible for all reports back to TC39. TC39 will review membership on a regular basis.

### How the subCommittee Will Respond to Reports

When a report is sent to the subcommittee they will immediately reply to the report to confirm receipt. This reply must be sent within 24 hours, and the subcommittee should strive to respond more quickly than that.

See the [Reporting Guidelines][] for details of what reports should contain. If a report doesn't contain enough information, the subcommittee will obtain all relevant data before acting. The subcommittee is empowered to act on the TC39's behalf in contacting any individuals involved to get a more complete account of events.

The subcommittee will then review the incident and determine, to the best of their ability:

*   What happened.
*   Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation.
*   Who, if anyone, was the bad actor.
*   Whether this is an ongoing situation, and if there is a threat to anyone's physical safety.

This information will be collected in writing, and whenever possible the subcommittee's deliberations will be recorded and retained (e.g. IRC transcripts, email discussions, or recorded voice conversations).

The subcommittee should aim to have a resolution agreed upon within one week. In the event that a resolution can't be determined in that time, the subcommittee will respond to the reporter(s) with an update and projected timeline for resolution.

### Acting Unilaterally

If the act is ongoing (such as someone engaging in harassment on IRC), or involves a threat to anyone's safety (e.g. threats of violence), any committee member or moderator may act immediately (before reaching consensus) to end the situation. In ongoing situations, any moderator may at their discretion employ any of the tools available to the committee, including bans and blocks.

If the incident involves physical danger, any member of the committee may -- and should -- act unilaterally to protect safety. This can include contacting law enforcement (or other local personnel) and speaking on behalf of the TC39.

In situations where an individual committee member acts unilaterally, they must report their actions to the subcommittee for review within 24 hours.

### Resolutions

The subcommittee must agree on a resolution by consensus. If the subcommittee cannot reach consensus and deadlocks for over a week, the subcommittee will turn the matter over to TC39 for resolution.

Possible responses may include:

*   Taking no further action (if we determine no violation occurred).
*   A private reprimand from the subcommittee to the individual(s) involved. In this case, the subcommittee chair will deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) over email, cc'ing the subcommittee.
*   A public reprimand. In this case, the subcommittee chair will deliver that reprimand in the same venue that the violation occurred (e.g. in IRC for an IRC violation; email for an email violation). The subcommittee may choose to publish this message elsewhere for posterity.
*   An imposed vacation (e.g. asking someone to "take a week off" from a mailing list or IRC). The subcommittee chair will communicate this "vacation" to the individual(s). They'll be asked to take this vacation voluntarily, but if they don't agree then a temporary ban may be imposed to enforce this vacation.
*   A permanent or temporary ban from some or all TC39 spaces. The subcommittee will maintain records of all such bans so that they may be reviewed in the future, extended to new TC39 fora, or otherwise maintained.
*   A request for a public or private apology. The chair will deliver this request. The subcommittee may, if it chooses, attach "strings" to this request: for example, the subcommittee may ask a violator to apologize in order to retain his or her membership on a mailing list.

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the subcommittee will contact the original reporter and any other affected parties and explain the proposed resolution. The subcommittee will ask if this resolution is acceptable, and must note feedback for the record. However, the subcommittee is not required to act on this feedback.

Finally the subcommittee will make a report of the TC39 members and respective delegates and the ECMA secretariat. The subcommittee will never publicly discuss the issue; all public statements will be made by the TC39 Chair and/or the ECMA Secretariat.

### Conflicts of Interest

In the event of any conflict of interest a subcommittee member must immediately notify the other members, and recuse themselves if necessary.
